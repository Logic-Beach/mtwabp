MakeTheworldABetterPlace.eth is an effort to do just that. We use the desire to earn POAPs to create actionable change in the real world.
The idea is that if you undertake a world changing task to earn a POAP even once you will be 10x more likely to add actions like these to your life on a regular basis.
After all, we subscribe to the idea that POAPs aid us in becoming who we want to be. You may want to do these things in theory, but lack the motivation. We are offering a simple form of motivation!

If you have any ideas for challenges or simply want to reach out and show support please find us @MakeTheWorldA13 on Twitter.
