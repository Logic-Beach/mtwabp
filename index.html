		<h1> Make The World A Better Place</h1>

		<div class='intro'>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p><b>
			MakeTheworldABetterPlace.eth is an effort to do just that. We use the desire to earn POAPs to create actionable change in the real world. 
			<br><br>
			The idea is that if you undertake a task to earn a POAP even once you will be more likely to add actions like it to your life on a regular basis. 
			<br><br>
			We subscribe to the idea that POAPs aid us in becoming who we want to be. You may want to do these things in theory, but lack the motivation.
			<br><br>
			We are offering a simple form of motivation!
			<br><br>
			To submit your entry for a POAP or if you have any ideas for challenges or simply want to reach out and show support please find us <a href="https://twitter.com/MakeTheWorldA13" target='_blank'> @MakeTheWorldA13 on Twitter.</a>
